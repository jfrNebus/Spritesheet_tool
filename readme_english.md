SpriteSheeter is a tool meant to make me be able to deal, in an easier way, with an issue related with a project I am 
occasionally working on.
I started working in a 2D graphics pixel art game, which it's developed for Android, with a test mode basic user
interface. Although the project was in a very early stage, I developed a system to get individual objects, sprites, 
out of the provided sprite sheet. In addition, this system allows me to set the size of a new canvas, fitting the its
resolution to the screen's resolution, keeping in mind the DPI value of the screen.

The project was left unfinished, and it was only a few weeks ago when I got it back. The first thing i thought about,
when i was trying to remember how the code works, was that the way to make the map was really annoying and that I
needed a tool to deal with it.

<br>

### The problem :finnadie:

<br>

I've never searched on the internet how to make a 2D graphics pixel art game. I just got the idea of splitting into sameller
images the sprite sheet, to be able able to use them inside the code. This means that there's just one image in the 
resources folder in the proyect.

A sprite sheet is an image that's made up of smaller images that represent every possible element in the game. In a sprite
sheet, we can also find all the frames needed to make an animation. This way, in a game like Mario Bros, the ground is 
created by repeating a single stone sprite, and the floating brick platforms are created from a single brick sprite.

I finally got a system which splits the sprite sheet into smaller images that can be used as sprites. The system creates
anonymous sprites, they get their id from the map where they are stored, which assigns a number _key_ to them. This way, 
the top left corner sprite is sprite number 0, the next one in that row is sprite number 1, and so on, considering
all the rows and columns in the sprite sheet. Understanding this idea, a bigger picture can be created from smaller pics,
knowing their ID.

<br>

</p>

<br>

Let's consider the previous drawing, a tree... üòµ. The left tree is the sprite sheet, it holds all the sprites needed to 
draw it. By repeating some of those sprites we made a bigger tree in the right part of the picture. If we make a system
which is able to make a picture from an ID list, where each of those IDs in the list represents a specific sprite, we will
be able to make maps out of two-dimensional arrays, with just one media image, the original sprite sheet.

<br>

```
int[][] newMap = {
{0, 1, 2},
{3, 4, 5},
{3, 4, 5},
{6, 7, 8},
{9, 10, 11},
{9, 10, 11},
{12, 13, 14},
};
```

<br>

The system iterates over the array newMap, each array inside newMap represents a row in the canvas, and its elements
represent each sprite in that row. All the elements in the position 0 at each row array, are the sprites in the column
number 0; the sprites in the position number 1 at each array are the elements in the column number 1, and all the sprites
in the position 2 at each array are the elements in the column number 2. This example is easy to follow, it is a small
image, creating two-dimensional arrays get complicated when the map to be created is either big or complex. 

<br>

<p align="center", background="black">
 <b>Test canvas</b>
 <br>
 <br>
 <img src="docs/default_layer.png" width="160" height="160"/> <img src="docs/new_layer.png" width="160" height="160"/>
 <img src="docs/new_layer_2.png" width="160" height="160"/> <img src="docs/new_layer_3.png" width="160" height="160"/> 
 <img src="docs/full_canvas.png" width="160" height="160"/>
</p>

<br>

The last picture on the right shown above, is created by mixing all the previous layers shown on its left. Each layer has
its own sprites.

<br>

```
int[][] default_layer = {
{169,169,169,169,169},
{169,169,169,169,169},
{169,169,169,169,169},
{169,169,169,169,169},
{169,169,169,169,169}
};

int[][] new_layer = {
{0,0,0,0,0},
{104,104,104,108,56},
{209,209,209,159,56},
{311,311,311,312,0},
{412,412,412,413,0}
};

int[][] new_layer_2 = {
{216,216,216,0,0},
{216,377,378,0,0},
{216,428,429,474,475},
{216,216,216,525,526},
{0,0,0,0,0}
};

int[][] new_layer_3 = {
{71,72,216,216,66},
{122,123,124,0,0},
{173,174,0,0,0},
{224,227,0,0,0},
{0,0,0,0,0}
};

```

<br>

It's easy to realize that, trying to make all the two-dimensional arrays of such an easy picture, 80x80 pixels with 5 
sprites on each row, each sprite 16 pixels in side size, becomes quite complicated. It's something not to even consider, 
if the map to be created has to be several hundreds of sprites big.

<br>

### The tool üß∞
 
<br>
  
<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/Main_window.png"/>
</p>

<br>

Yep, I am absolutely not a professional making user interfaces üòÜ. Nevertheless, it works!

The first thing shown when the program starts, is an small window where you can set the path where the sprite sheet 
is located in the machine, through a search window that pops up by clicking on the path text box, or by pasting the path
string on the path text box itself. In addition, the amount of side pixels of each spite, as well as the side pixels of 
the canvas values must be set.

Once all the starting fields are filled and committed, a new window, with clearly defined parts, will appear. On the left
side, there's an area where all the buttons, with each sprite of the sprite sheet as icon, are located. For this example it
is being used the [sprite sheet](SpriteSheeter/Resources/tiles.png) whose author is ![Buch](docs/CreditsToBuch.txt). By 
clicking on them, each sprite will be printed in the red square which is inside the canvas on the right part of the program,
squared in black. In between the sprite list and the canvas, there's located a list with each layer's buttons. Each radial
check box will hide the layer which it is attached to, and each layer's button will set the canvas where the sprites will
be drawn.

The cursor will be moved by using the directional keys, or by using the keys _a w s d_. Using the key Shift together with
the keys + or - will zoom the sprite sheet in and out inside the _Sprites list_ area. The same will happen to the canvas
by using the key Ctrl together with the keys + and -. The Intro key will change the cursor's state, toggling the green
behaviour, which will print in the canvas, the last mouse clicked sprite in the _Sprites List, each time the cursor is moved
to a new location. This behaviour will remain till the intro key is pressed again, setting the cursor state back to red mode.

In the top left corner of the window there's a dropdown menu. This menu offers the option load a new sprite sheet; to clear or
delete the current layer, or all the layers at onces; the option to import or export a _.txt_ file in order to save or load 
the work done; it allows to export the current canvas as a _.png_ file, keeping in mind that any hidden layer won't be printed; 
or the option to read a brief list of keyboard shortcuts.

Finally, in the bottom left part of the window there are buttons to control the zoom level applied to the sprite sheet and
to the canvas; a text field where the name of new layers will be written, or where the text generated when the option to export
code has been selected will be written; and the new layer button, which will generate the new layer, setting as its name 
the text written in the text block, in ASCII format.

<br>

### The fruit üçìüçåü•ù
 
<br>

The goal of this program is not to get the final image, the canvas is there just to guide the one who is creating the 
picture. The final goal is to get the code bloc written in the _.txt_ file, once the _Export code_ option is selected.

```
//Sprites in side = 5

int[][] default_layer = {
{169,169,169,169,169},

The previous code was written in the _.txt_ file generated for the _**Test canvas**_ picture shown above. The field ##Path## 
will show the path to the directory where the sprite sheet is located. The line "//Sprites in side = 5", the line showing the
path to the sprite sheet, and the lines "//name_of_layer=array_of_numbers", are the lines that will be used to rebuild 
the sprite sheet, the layer list, and the canvas, when the file has been imported. And finally, all the arrays and the 
commented layer names, are the fields that will be copied and pasted in the game project.

<br>

### Conclusion üôå

<br>

This proyect is not a masterpiece, there are still lots of points in the _todo_ list and mistakes to fix and to improve.
There are features to be added or to be removed, and a long etc of considerations that any professional could add to it.
Actually, this tool could even be not needed, because maybe the way to make game maps is not like the one I got. Nevertheless,
even when there are already professional tools to achieve the goal of this program, this project allowed me to keep improving my
coding skills and my poor layout programming. It allowed me to learn a bit more about how to browse and deal with files, and it 
allowed me to keep improving my _best practices_. And, in case I am in the mood to keep developing this game, which is not my 
priority, this tool will be a great help üòÉ.
