List of changes done before commit:
- Refactor: fixed multiple spelling mistakes over the documentation
- Bug fix: enableUI() moved to the actions to be performed when the OK button was pressed successfully while creating
 a new canvas.
- Feature: Added a conditional to check if there are layers to when the process to import a saved file is started. This
way, if there are layers they will be deleted, and if there are no layeres there won't be any call to deleteAllLayers().
